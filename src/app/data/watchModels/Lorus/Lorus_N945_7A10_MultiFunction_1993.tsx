  description: {
    text:
      "What seems to be just a simple Lorus watch, happens to be one of the most complex and interesting watches that I ever come across. \n" +
      "The movement of this Lorus, the Shiojiri N945, was only used in very few Seiko watches itself, like the Seiko Hiper-Tech Titanium. \n \n " +
      "Apart from this model, this movement can mostly be found in sub-Seiko brands like Lorus, Pulsar, Radiant, Spalding and Yema. \n \n" +
      "From my research, Lorus just seems to assemble a different combination of dials and cases for this series watches. \
        The watch case varies from two main options: the case using a tachymeter bezel similar to the Omega Speedmaster ( the bezel colour could combine \
             whit the dial colour)  and the case using a more highlighted bezel, whit the style of the Rolex Daytona.   \
             In every option, the case was gold plated whit at least 10 microns. \n \n" +
      "Other cases were used to assemble this movement but those models are less common. \n" +
      "As main functions, the watch offers five functions, which can be alternated by turning the crown (without pulling it out) \n \n" +
      " - <b>CHRONO</b> mode: Chronograph using all subdials and hands. The seconds' hand count in a sweeping movement, as an automatic or mechanical watch; \n" +
      " - <b>TIME</b> mode: Display the time. The opposite side of the second's hand uses a half-moon to point the day  of the month in the dial; \n" +
      " - <b>TIMER</b> mode: Used to control regressive timer function. The movement works counter clock-wise and the  seconds' hands move one time per second; \n" +
      " - <b>ALARM</b>:Either over TIME or SET mode. Changes to control the alarm function; \n" +
      " - <b>0</b> mode: used to reset and adjust the position of all the hands. \n \n" +
      "These particular Lorus models are hard to find in good condition. ",
